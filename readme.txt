Chubby Checkers: Neural Networks learn to play
----------------------------------------------
In this project I created a checkers board representation,
Neural Network implementation, network client to play
games against other competing teams (server was provided)
and a GUI for watching games play out between different
neural nets.

Folders:

Board
    - Contains neural net, generation computation and 
      checkers rules and board representation code.

Client
    - Containts provided python server code as well as
      C++ client code for playing our neural nets against
      opponents.

Gui
    - Contains a openGL display that allows stepping
      forward and backwards through checkers games
      to observer neural nets playing.

Generations
    - Contains all generations generated from our running
      time on the ARSC supercomputer FISH.
